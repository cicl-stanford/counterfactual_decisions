836,24,Non-Hispanic,"If the doors opening or closing was ""fair"", then the player choosing had alot to do with their winning or losing.",Non-binary,Asian,285684
837,26,Non-Hispanic,I looked at whether it was possible to reach the goal through both paths which took into account the doors and the remaining timesteps.,Male,White,672873
838,30,Non-Hispanic,"If the player would have won (or lost)
regardless of which path they took, I answered in the middle, because yes they won (or lost) due to which path they chose, but they also would have won(or lost) if they chose the other.",Male,White,721809
839,35,Non-Hispanic,"I paid close attention to the opening and closing of the doors, comparing the timing to determine if it made a difference in whether the player won or lost.",Male,White,1040834
840,23,Non-Hispanic,"If it wasn't clear if the red path or blue path was better, I estimated how many timesteps it would take per path if the gates closed or opened at different times and decided from there.",Transgender man,White,490388
841,30,Non-Hispanic,"If either path would have resulted in a lost, then I answered that the loss was not at all due to the particular path chosen. But since the doors open at random and I'm not sure how the randomness would have played out had the player chosen the other path first, I could only answer based on the gameplay that I saw. ",Male,Black/African American,1485140
842,44,Non-Hispanic,How they would have done on the other path was the primary factor,Male,White,332128
843,45,Non-Hispanic,how the doors took long to open,Female,White,676028
844,43,Non-Hispanic,"I was following what payer is doing and pay attention to when door will open on each path, and then I got to conclusion",Female,White,1170368
846,30,Non-Hispanic,Whether the chose the right path and whether there was ever any chance of them winning--some times there was no chance either way and sometimes either path would have made them win ,Female,White,321068
847,24,Non-Hispanic,I check to see if choosing the other path would also clear or fail the game.,Female,Asian,592115
848,40,Non-Hispanic,Usually what influenced me was whether the door opened on the path that wasn't chosen.,Female,White,430229
849,28,Non-Hispanic,I tried to see if there was any way for the player to win at all.,Female,White,393535
850,31,Non-Hispanic,Mostly decided based off of how quickly the player got to the star if they got to the star and based off of the doors opening in time or staying closed. I thought it was a lot of fun!,Female,White,449192
851,42,Non-Hispanic,"Mostly whether each door opened and the player could have gotten to the star. Even on those where they were unlucky to have selected the ""correct"" path, I did not accord all the fault to the player since door opening is random and there is no skill that can overcome randomness. Thus the player cannot be completely at fault.",Male,White,719021

854,70,Non-Hispanic,no,Female,White,388584
855,39,Non-Hispanic,"If they took one path and won, and would not have won if they took the other path, then I believe they won because of the path they chose.

If they took one path and won, and would have still won if they took the other path, then they would have won either way and it was not because of the path they chose. ",Male,White,545642
856,31,Non-Hispanic,"How long the door stayed opened or closed, it didn't matter whether he chose the red or blue path what mattered was whether or not the door opened or closed or if there was a door at all on the path",Female,White,984189
858,27,Non-Hispanic,The doors were the main factor in deciding how I responded.,Male,White,610229
859,60,Non-Hispanic,If there were other possibilities,Male,White,405163
860,40,Non-Hispanic,On some of the rounds it didn't matter which way they picked so I put the slider in the middle.,Male,White,709195
861,36,Hispanic,"I watched both paths and decided whether or not I believed the result would have been the same on the other path, or different. ",Female,Multiracial,574298

869,59,Non-Hispanic,"The way I responded was it did not matter either path that was taken, the chances of winning or losing were the same. I don't think it had anything to do with which path was chosen. The experiment failed to load 3 times.",Female,Black/African American,1522452
870,31,Non-Hispanic,"My answers were based on whether one path or both would result in reaching the goal. For example, if the player picked the red path and only the blue path would have resulted in a win; the loss was completely decided on picking the red path.",Male,Middle Eastern,581728

872,32,Non-Hispanic,I paid attention to both paths to see what would have happened if they had chosen the other one.,Female,White,478281
873,57,Non-Hispanic,It's pretty obvious. If both routes are open or closed then it's 50/50. If one works and the other doesn't then of course it's easy to judge it's correct or not.,Male,Asian,1160136
874,35,Non-Hispanic,Basically watching both paths and how they changed. Did the other path allow the player to make it while the one they selected did not? How close were they? What did the obstacles do and when did they do them?,Male,White,673121

877,68,Non-Hispanic,I watched both doors to see which was open the soonest (including immediately) as it was approached. In a few cases the wait was so long it didn't matter which path/door was chosen. I put 50% if either path would have worked.,Male,White,622805

881,47,Non-Hispanic,Looked at when doors opened on each path,Female,Black/African American,426771
882,71,Non-Hispanic,I changed my decisions as the game progressed. I started to factor in the likelihood of the other path winning. If I were to play again I would assign different probabilities to the earlier rounds.,Male,White,1223193
