904,41,Non-Hispanic,"I looked at how many ""timesteps"" remained when the door was shut for the other path and where the count time was when the door opened. If the count was less than the remaining timesteps (or blocks) to progress to reach the star, then I answered there was no chance for the other path to win. Same in reverse if the count was more than the remaining timesteps (blocks) then the other path was winnable. ",Female,Asian,854709

I watched when the doors opened/closed on that path and counted if the doors would have prevented the circle from reaching the star in time.

903,20,Non-Hispanic,"First, a comment: I at first thought that the door would only open if the player was in front of it, but at a rather time. Because of this some of my early responses are dead wrong. I was guessing that in the opposite path, the door might have opened (but in the video it remained closed). But once I figured out how it worked I just watched to see if the player would be able to get through the doors and have enough steps left to win.",Female,White,506393
