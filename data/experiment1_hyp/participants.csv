977,33,Non-Hispanic,"So long as the same number of doors appeared in both sides and nothing else changed, I didn't see a clear enough pattern to determine which one was better, so they seemed about equally likely.",Female,White,424463

953,59,Non-Hispanic,"At first it was kind of random, then I realized if the door was shut to start, it often would open. But if it was open to start, if it was near the end, it would likely close before the man got that far.",Female,White,389112

955,19,Non-Hispanic,I realized the odds of winning are prob closer to not winning if it takes 7 moves to win and the doors open randomly most of the time. I accidentally answered not winning on one of them without doors by mistake.,Male,White,373614

981,22,Non-Hispanic,"Since we have no way of knowing if the doors will open or close, there should be an equal chance of the player winning or losing for each round. I made a mistake on the round with no doors, there should have been a 100% chance of them winning in that scenario regardless of the path ",Female,Multiracial,355041
997,34,Non-Hispanic,"I stayed neutral on all the ones with doors on each path because the doors are random, so I felt there was an equal chance for each",Female,White,748684

952,48,Non-Hispanic,"This is lame. 

Because gates can randomly close, the probability of any path leading to success is not controlled by the selection made unless the path does not have a gate at all.",Female,White,529424
998,58,Non-Hispanic,"this is kinda stupid. becauze the doors open and close randomly, you cannot predict.  the I missed the one maze where there were no doors--that one should have been all the way to 'will make it'....but all the other ones were random chance.",Female,White,446755

958,20,Non-Hispanic,whether or not a door was open or closed or if there were no doors,Male,White,295428
956,19,Non-Hispanic,"I thought about how close the doors were to the start, and if they were open or closed, but this was the same for either path.",Female,White,374508

978,25,Non-Hispanic,"If there were doors open or not. Also kind of based on how things turned out during the previous game. But mostly, I just felt it was based on luck.",Female,White,406692
946,30,Hispanic,"if a door was open, more then likely it would close and result in a lose and if it was closed then there is a 50 50 shot it would open or stay closed so just had to gamble",Male,Latino/Hispanic,423684
961,20,Non-Hispanic,,Female,White,337926
995,25,Non-Hispanic,I chose down the middle for the most part because there is no clear way to tell which path will allow the player to succeed. ,Female,White,495753
948,54,Non-Hispanic,"Since the door opening was random, I corresponded my answer random for the door closed options.  FOr the other, it was also random as to when the door would CLOSE but either way, it was a ton of fun and I want to play again!  :)",Female,White,515561
949,37,Non-Hispanic,"Over time I thought I noticed a correlation between the location of the doors relative to the starting point and how quickly they closed. For example I suspected that an open door closer to the starting line might stay open longer than an open door farther from the starting line would. 
Also, I think you may have placed an attention check partway through the experience, when there was a map with no doors on either side. At the time I answered that there was a low degree of likelihood that the player would make it through in time. My reasoning at the time was that there was a chance that the game was rigged and that a door might suddenly magically appear. Maybe this was considered ""metagaming"" since doing so required me to respond as if I was not aware of the rules. I just wanted to point this out in case it was indeed an attention check that would have given the impression that I failed it.",Male,White,471202
970,18,Non-Hispanic,I mainly based my predictions on the previous attempts.,Male,White,238746
984,40,Non-Hispanic,No Factors.  I guessed because there is no way to predict if the door would open or when it would open. ,Female,American Indian/Alaska Native,739441
